# Used technologies
In order to achieve this project, we used Html CSS and Javascript so as to make this app web friendly. We tried to divide our Javascript as much as possible using multiple files inside which we would mainly define all functions needed for the main script to work properly. 

# Game User's Manual
## What is it ?
Here you will find our attempt to recreate "Vision" game from chess.com.
It contains multiple game modes including two time trial modes and one survival mode.

### Goal:
Upon starting the game, a random square positions will be generated and your goal is to find as many as possible on the chessboard before the timer runs out.

An additional "Survival Mode" is also available where you are given three lives. In this mode you have three seconds to find each square on the chessboard. As these three seconds run out, you will loose on life. The game ends when you run out of life.

So ready, set, GO! Train yourself with this app and beat your highscore!
